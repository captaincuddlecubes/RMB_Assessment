About this solution:

Node.js (version 6.3.1) was used to solve this problem. 

Note that Node.js allows for javascript to be run natively on a machine, and uses Googles V8 javascript engine to run the javascript. 

I took a recursive function approach to solve this problem, and broke the problem up into functions (which can be found in the file functions.js); 


****** How to run ******
After Node.js is installed on a computer, just open your command promt or linux terminal and nativate to this folder. 
type in and press enter: 
node index.js
